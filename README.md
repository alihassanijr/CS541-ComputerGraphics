# CS541 - Intro to Computer Graphics

## Overview

## Project 1

Project 1 is the basics: implementing the scanline algorithm, color interpolation, z-buffer, and 3D transformations.
It was previously set up with VTK, but that became a challenge over time so now we're writing things from scratch.

**Project 1-A:** PNM writer and a sample image

**Project 1-B:** Implement a limited rasterizer able to plot upward triangles 
(two vertices have an identical y value, and the third has a higher y value.)

**Project 1-C:** Extend 1-B to support arbitrary triangles.

**Project 1-D:** Implement color interpolation and z-buffer to support depth.

## Credits
CS 441/541 (Winter 2023) was instructed by [Prof. Hank Childs](https://cdux.cs.uoregon.edu/childs.html).
So far one of my favorite courses in grad school!
